## Plan updates

We decided that our tarot cards can be ran as a website but also downloaded as an app, and as we code, code it as if it were a website. There will be three main pages in our website: intro, select card, and result.

## Sumit and Ben
- Scraped from trustedtarot.com and stored card descriptions and info in a json document

## Maanasa and Kartik
- Worked on results page, fetching meaning behind the three chosen cards from the select card page and displaying the result to user on this page.

## Linda and Nathan
- Worked to redesign the intro page and integrate 8 ball into the Homepage. Additiona, updated the README.md and instructions.html to detail instructions on how the tarot card reading works and how to switch to an 8 ball reading instead.

## Bingyang and Shole
- Worked on pop up components for the cards

## Haoyang and Nick
- Worked on select card page
