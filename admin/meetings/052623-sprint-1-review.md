## Plan updates

We decided that our tarot cards can be ran as a website but also downloaded as an app, and as we code, code it as if it were a website. There will be three main pages in our website: intro, select card, and result.

## Sumit and Ben

-   Scraped from trustedtarot.com and stored card descriptions and info in a json document. Updated the fake JSON file of all the cards and their meanings in terms of past present and future, by getting the information off of a tarot card meaning website. Should be able to display these messages on the popup when a card is clicked and on the results/summary page.

## Maanasa and Kartik

-   Worked on results page, fetching meaning behind the three chosen cards from the select card page and displaying the result to user on this page. Made a fake JSON and took names and meanings from it and displayed it. Added a go back button and everything works. Didn't have time to work on the CSS so it doesn't match the rest of app style wise but will be the next task.

## Linda and Nathan

-   Worked to redesign the intro page and integrate 8 ball into the Homepage. Additionally, updated the README.md and instructions.html to detail instructions on how the tarot card reading works and how to switch to an 8 ball reading instead.

## Bingyang and Shole

-   Worked on pop up components for the cards. Created the CardPop.js file as a component of flip card. It's the first draft, and created a fake value of the front image, but it will be changed later after the select-cards part works.

## Haoyang and Nick

-   Worked on select card page. Haoyang finished the select cards; will comment it later to make sure its easy to understand. This change will affect the results page however; generated the card in select cards so the user could see which card they picked and so it would flip over.
