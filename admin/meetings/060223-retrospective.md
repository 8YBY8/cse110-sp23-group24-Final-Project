## Sprint Review

### Positives
- App looks a lot more uniform and made good progress
- Good teammwork, everyone worked well together and accomplished a lot

### Negatives
- App does not have enough features, more could be implemented
- Not enough work allocated to some groups, too much allocated to others
- Repository is a bit confusing and not cleaned

# Going Forward
- Better allocation of work
- Check in with teammates to see if they would like to try or pursue another aspect of the app during next sprint
- Clean repository as a group
