                    The first card you choose will give you a reading on your
                    past. This may represent something from your past that will
                    affect your future and is leading to your current state of
                    mind.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The second card you choose will give you a reading on your
                    present. This may represent your current state of mind or
                    decisions you may need to make.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The third card you choose will give you a reading on your
                    future. This may represent what will occur once you make a
                    decision based on your present or what the future will hold
                    for you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is no right or wrong answer for choosing cards. Choose
                    a card that you feel like you are drawn to, or just choose
                    randomly!
