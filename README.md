- While we were going to initally use Electron to create a desktop app, the Professor suggested that we should go for a mobile-first approach as most users will be engaging with our content via their phone. Thus, we instead decided to build a progressive web application with vite. It allows us to create a web application that scales perfectly between phone and laptop and provide support for both.

### App Creators

Hi! We are undergraduate students currently attending University of California, San Diego. We are enrolled in CSE 110, a class about software engineering and this is our final project. We came up with the idea of tarot cards and 8 ball because we are passionate about using our software engineering skills to create forms of entertainment and add some fun to fortune telling in a creative way.
