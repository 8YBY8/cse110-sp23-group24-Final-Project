Hi! We are undergraduate students currently attending University of California, San Diego. We are enrolled in CSE 110, a class about software engineering and this is our final project. We came up with the idea of tarot cards because we are passionate about using our software engineering skills to create forms of entertainment and add some fun to fortune telling in a creative way.
